# Lecture notes

In this page I share notes I write for lectures I teach.

- [Crash course on causal limits in the LOCAL model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sIKyOMABsolJOMdYI7PkuCKXH1rnkf12/view?usp=sharing). This is a three-lectures PhD class I gave at Gran Sasso Science Institute (L'Aquila, Italy) in July 2024.
