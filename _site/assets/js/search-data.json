I am interested in two key computing models: . | LOCAL model: Models with minimal restrictions on computational power and communication bandwidth. | GOSSIP model: Models with strong restrictions. | . Current Projects . | Investigating quantum communication to explore its potential benefits (or limitations) in the LOCAL model. | Developing and/or analyzing algorithms for the consensus problem and collaborative search in distributed systems. | . Additional Research . I also work on theoretical machine learning and statistics. For instance: . | Studying the Random Subset Sum Problem and its applications in understanding the efficiency of pruning (non-trained) neural networks. | Occasionally contributing to statistical analysis in medicine and biology. | .
